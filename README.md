# Emory BMI's Journey with Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2025: Pioneering Open Source Biomedical Informatics


<img src="https://github.com/NISYSLAB/Emory-BMI-GSoC/blob/main/logo.jpg" width="150" height="150" align="left" /> Welcome to the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Emory University, a beacon of innovation in open-source development for biomedical informatics research. Department of Biomedical Informatics, Emory University (often stylized "Emory BMI" for GSoC communications) is committed to open source development of several biomedical informatics research projects. As a research organization, its source code lives across several open-source project repositories, released with open-source licenses including BSD 3-Clause License and MIT license. Most of them can be accessed from the GitHub repositories of the research labs of Emory University School of Medicine: https://github.com/NISYSLAB


**Celebrating a Decade of Impact:**
Since our initial steps in GSoC 2012 to the remarkable milestones of 2024, Emory BMI has continued to thrive, welcoming numerous contributors year after year. As we gear up for GSoC 2025, we're excited to mentor a new wave of innovators, guiding them from contributors to long-term collaborators. Emory BMI takes pride in having past successes and GSoC contributors turn into long-term collaborators and mentors themselves. Emory BMI also encourages the contributors to collaborate further towards research outcomes, alongside their coding, as most of our GSoC projects include a fair amount of research.

**Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion:**
At Emory BMI, we ardently believe in the power of diversity to drive innovation. We are dedicated to creating an inclusive environment that encourages participation from all backgrounds, especially aiming to empower women and minorities in science and technology. Your unique perspectives are invaluable to us, and we invite you to join our diverse community of thinkers and creators.


**We have been using Slack as the primary medium of communication. Since Slack has limited the features of the Slack free version, we are slowly moving away from Slack and asking the contributors to communicate via the discussion forums of each project and this central repository instead. These discussion forums also give the contributors the potential to reach a larger audience through their public discussions, providing more transparency to our open-source development discussions.**

Please refer to the [contributor guidelines](/CONTRIBUTOR-GUIDANCE.md) for more details on how to apply and a standard template for the application. The ideas list is given below.

# List of Ideas
Discuss the project on the project's discussion forum (as listed below under each project idea), and once you are ready to submit your application, use the template below. **You must submit your application directly using the GSoC Program Site.** If you have a project idea that is relevant for Emory Biomedical Informatics, but is not listed here, feel free to consult the mentors to discuss your idea. The ideas listed below can be open for interpretation. Feel free to discuss with the mentors for clarifications, questions, or alternative suggestions.

The ideas are marked easy, medium, and hard in difficulty level. They are also tagged 90, 175, and 350 hours. These three values represent small-size, medium, and large projects.
